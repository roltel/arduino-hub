The Arduino Relay Shield provides an easy way for smart appliance control. It covers control to normal load circuits with 4 photo-coupled solid state relay capable of switching DC90W (or AC360VA).
It also provides stand alone power supply, xBee type wireless module socket, and Native Arduino compatibility. It can be controlled through the digital IO port, such as solenoid valves, lamps, motors and other high current or high voltage devices.
Note: There are 2 ways of powering relay shield when carried by an Arduino board
Connect 9VDC to Arduino board.
