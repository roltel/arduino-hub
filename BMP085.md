# Introduction #

The BMP085 has a digital interface, I2C to be specific. This means there may is a bit more overhead to get it talking to your microcontroller, but in return you get data that is much less susceptible to noise and other factors that may hamper an analog signal. I2C is a synchronous two-wire interface, the first wire, SDA, transmits data, while a second wire, SCL, transmits a clock, which is used to keep track of the data. If you're using an Arduino to talk to the BMP085, the Wire library will conveniently take care of most of the work in communicating with the sensor.

Now, if you take a gander at the bottom side of the BMP085 Breakout you'll notice the labels of all six pins: 'SDA', 'SCL', 'XCLR', 'EOC', 'GND, and 'VCC.' VCC and GND are obviously the power pins. SDA and SCL are the I2C communication lines. SDA being where the data is transmitted, and SCL is the clock that keeps track of that data. The last two pins, XCLR and EOC, are a couple extra functions of the BMP085. XCLR acts as a master reset. It's active-low, so if it's pulled to GND it will reset the BMP085 and set its registers to their default state. EOC, standing for "end of conversion", is a signal generated by the BMP085 that's triggered whenever a pressure or temperature conversion has finished. These last two pins are optional, and if you don't need to use them you can just leave them unconnected.

BMP085 Pin	Pin Function

VCC	 Power (1.8V-3.6V)

GND	 Ground

EOC	 End of conversion output

XCLR	 Master Clear (low-active)

SCL	 Serial Clock I/O

SDA	 Serial Data I/O


Pay special attention to how you power the BMP085. Its maximum supply voltage is 3.6V. So don't go feeding it 5V! If you've got a regular Arduino Uno, use the 3.3V header to supply power to the chip.
